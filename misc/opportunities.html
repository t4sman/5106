  <article class="text"><h1>Opportunities for technology.</h1><br><p class="textbody">
    Technology around us is continuously changing, it creates open opportunities for everyone just from their phone, tablet or laptop. Mobile phones have transitioned the way we communicate going from the landline and having to write down everyone's phone number in a book to being able to save contact information under any name from any country and with just the click of a button you can be making a call to anyone. Access to information has been improved, instead of having to flip through a book trying to find the answer you are now a google search away from finding the answer within seconds. News is all transmitted within seconds to the other side of the world through social media rather than taking a few days from word to word phone calls. The opportunities that the current and future upgrading technology around us is a massive breakthrough and although so much can already be done through a small device a lot more is yet to come. 
    <br><br>
Within our current society everyone has a phone but not everyone has the internet to keep up with the latest news and data therefore developing countries such as India, China and Africa have created a messaging awareness alert system that sends out a message to everyones phone with or without internet updating them on major issues and diseases within their area such as HIV, Tuberculosis, AIDS, Covid and other common outbreaks within that area. This system has provided a way for the community to be updated with what is happening around them and many countries have seen this and embedded this alert system into their own communities since the major coronavirus outbreak. This is just the beginning of the many opportunities that modern technology can provide to everyone. A system on messaging awareness was first taken from amber alerts back in 1996 which was nationwide alerts sent to every phone within a certain radius about a missing person, it was a way of the community being notified about something that they could help with by sending in information to the police if they had seen anything that matched the amber alert. Just a year after this in 1997 awareness alerts were created in which, like an amber alert, all phones within a certain radius would be notified of any major issues or diseases. These alerts then transformed into messages becoming a lot more comfortable for the wider community to receive rather than being woken up at 3am to an alarm blaring alert of having a flu outbreak and making it easier for those who don’t wish to receive the alerts to just block the number sending the alerts. Amber alerts still use an alarm system but for emergency purposes such as a tornado, earthquake or other natural disaster within the area, and as technology progresses at such a fast rate many opportunities of how to redefine the current system are already being made.

The current advancement of AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) health care has many open door opportunities coming their way. No one really looked towards booking their doctor's appointment online or even thought that they could visit the doctor from their own home through an online call but times have changed, although there have been many drastic changes recently with the growing technology around us the opportunities are endless. AI and ML will be able to help doctors everyday with diagnosing patients and giving the correct medication/treatment. It can be a big guessing game for health professionals around the world to try to tell a patient exactly what is wrong with them and then giving them the correct treatment or medication especially after knowing how different everyone is from each other and that certain practices may not work for some people. With the help of AI and ML we will be able to possibly scan a patient to see what they are going through and what type of medication/treatment their body can and can’t handle. With this information it will not only be cost saving for many instead of having to buy different types of medication just for it to not work but also life saving for others who will be given the correct information about their illness before it is too late. It can also be used in a way to detect irregular vitals that may not be picked up by doctors therefore being able to stop or help with early detection of infections, illnesses and diseases. With just one scan the computer will be able to tell you what is regular with the body and what seems to be out of place, this can help medical professionals gain a headstart on treatment before it worsens or becomes untreatable.

Education has also taken a step closer to technology use from BYOD (bring your own device) to online learning, but since online learning it is hard to track if a student is cheating on a test or really doing it themself, but this case will soon be closed and make it nearly impossible to cheat on a test from home. The use of AI and facial recognition can be used to see if the student is taking their own test or if someone else is taking it for them. Retina tracking can be used to see where the students' eyes are during the test to see if they are looking at their notes or someone behind the computer to help them. Recording and interpretation of mouth reading/movements can see if a student is getting help from someone else or talking to someone whilst taking the test helping catch out anything suspicious, some students may read the question out loud to themself and the AI might keep it as cheating but since everything would be recorded it can be analyzed back by a human to see if there was any foul play or not. With the help of a voice recognition software it can be easy to hear if there is more than one person in the room and to check that no test questions were being discussed with another person at the time of the quiz. The future of education has already made a drastic change but with how fast the future is moving the opportunities are endless to make sure everything is being done correctly using the correct methods and this can all be done through a camera.  
<br><br>
All in all, technology is advancing faster than ever. Some people may see this as a fear but when you look at the advancements we have made and how they have changed our lives to make it easier and simpler. We all know that the opportunities are endless and there is a lot more to come to help everyone.
