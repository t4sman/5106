  <article class="text"><h1>Choices</h1><br><p class="textbody">
    Choices are the decisions we make. They’re the very thought of good and bad. What we do now affects us going forward. Every action has consequence. According to our theme which is Technology has Upgraded society we tend to look at how choices bring technology to a cross section of right and wrong and do’s and do not’s. As if there were a list of pro’s and con’s that would lead to how you would use a statistically advanced creation of coding and knowledge. Technology is simpler built to make life easy. Sending a mail becomes sending a text, playing with friends in the backyard becomes playing Fortnite in the evening. Now choices are the very backbone of how we illustrate technology. There are things you can do and things you cannot do. And yet , technology is built so that you can arguably do anything. If we look at how technology has aged over years we have gone from rock and fire to the printing press to Laptops. But what does that mean? How does all of this relate to Technology upgrading society and the choices that follow that.
    <br><br>
Simply put, the choices we make with technology will always define our motives. We choose to talk to someone we send a message. We choose to entertain ourselves we open up YouTube. We choose to steal money we try to hack a bank account . Of course logically speaking some things are not as easy as the others but that doesn’t mean they aren’t possible. That is where ethics come into play. Ethics being the moral compass that guides every living human to do what’s right and wrong. If I were to choose to send an email to my boss at work I’m doing something relatively good. If I’m bullying a friend on the internet I’m doing something bad. We have a sight of where the line is and how we can manage how far is too far. But that’s not really the worst case scenario, people out in the world today choose to make bad decisions with technology regardless of mora ethic. Hackers, scammers identify thieves all exist for the sole purpose of reaping the benefit and they can do that with enough expertise if they have what it takes to master the methods of technology. Of course, it’s not easy to break into a bank account or steal someone’s data. Companies and creators always manage to create defences and firewalls, protective algorithms that stop or alert someone when a possible breach is in play. Bad decisions can happen with the use of technology and because technology is such a huge element of the modern day world. It’s a risk people have to take and a problem people still tend to solve and continuously fix. 
<br><br>
Good decisions are not far behind either. Just because bad decisions can be made on the internet doesn’t mean everyone is doing it. Good decisions aren’t exactly doing things like donating money to a save the bears foundation while that is a tactical portrait of how technology can be used to benefit a good cause the simplest of good deeds like wishing someone a good morning or buying yourself a new shirt on Amazon also count because they show that people are willing to work within their rules. There are set limits of what you can get and what you can do and following that is a decent way of accepting the rules of the technological world without trying to go out of your way to get something you want and creating havoc.  
<br><br>
Another example of choices can be seen through content creators. While people today do have the stability to record videos and play games on the internet with their own access to the internet the idea that you are sharing a piece of yourself does come into play. You are revealing how you sound, you are revealing how you look or how good you are at something or maybe what your room looks like or what your opinions are and that while it can be a nice format of personal use it also is an example of how you choose to portray yourself on the internet. Letting people share and watch whatever they want is a suitable notion for choices being made online. Before joining an application you agree to the terms and conditions. Before making a video public on the internet you verify you are real.  
<br><br>
Artificial intelligence is one of the bigger elements of technology and one of the most powerful. The idea of a talking computer that can see you, hear you, think for you and assist can be both cool but also scary. It makes sense that humans would go so far to evolve Nokia cellphones into talking computers because we have come so far as a species. But as we evolve so do the risks and choices we make with how we allow things to work around us. We can’t just allow blind trust in a robotic mind. We insist on knowing who we interact with before giving that entity any responsibility over our actions. We as a species do have our first instinct of alertness and then we make decisions to to trust or to evade. Possibility is one of the most expensive things given to life. The idea that what we think can one day be real. After all the idea of space is real, the idea of meteors. We created robots and flying metal birds and millions of super computers that rest in the palm of our hands.  We let our selves decide how we use it. Of course there are higher authorities who take charge when things are taken too far. Stealing information, looting money all can be punishable by law. But there also things like cyber bullying that while may not be the most dangerous in terms of law and order but still can be a small thorn that needs to be removed. Hence for example Twitter, one of the largest networks on social media today. People send comments, explain theories share ideas and argue over what they believe in. But if someone were to choose to make a harmful joke and another person doesn’t approve. Options of reporting and commenting back are given where you are given a chance to ban or protect yourself from the opposing counsel. It’s not as simple as good and bad but more so how serious and how crazy.  
<br><br>
Technology is the backbone of human evolution and along with that comes the ethical value of how far we are willing to go until we hit pause. Sometimes our curiosity gets the better of us and sometimes our moral compass gives us the right notion to avoid something that could possibly be lethal to our wellbeing online. Nothing can really advise you against how you choose to behave with your smartphone. What matters is how you let your decisions guide your actions through this wonderful creation.
