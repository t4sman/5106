  <article class="text"><h1>The risks of our technology</h1><br><p class="textbody">With great power comes great responsibility, society has seen many advancements over the last 20 years, with much of what we do today is now online. But, with such great opportunities for this technology in our society, some do come with their drawbacks. here, I outline some of the more prevalent risks of ever-advancing technology in our society.
<br><br><br>
  With automation on the rise, many companies are opting to switch to cashier-less checkouts, this is because for many companies on the national/international scale, it is cheaper to install these cashier-less checkouts to not need to pay workers to do the same job. This can be largely attributed to the ever-rising cost of employees and the ever-falling cost of computers. we already see many gas stations and supermarkets implementing self-serve checkouts/kiosks. It is estimated that at least 50% of the work done by those without a bachelor’s degree could be automated today; and is estimated to take over 47% of jobs in the US by 2030. This means that automation could potentially take over 73 million jobs in the United States, this isn’t all bad as automation has the potential to create 58 million new jobs in the US, but the loss of 15 million jobs in the US means this number is only bigger on the global scale, and many people will be affected by this. The industry that has already been severely affected by this would be the manufacturing industry; having 82.3% of all industry robots deployed in this industry. Since 2000, automation has already taken over at least 260,000 jobs in the US – 2% of the workforce in the US; and this number increases exponentially.

   With electronics being so available in our society, internet addiction is slowly becoming more of a problem. Internet addiction is the overuse of internet-enabled devices to the extend of disruption other priorities in someone’s life. The most common example of this would be using social media to replace face-to-face interaction. Using social media gives people a sense of socializing. This generally makes us be less social, as we feel satisfied by our phones. This allows for some people to develop social anxiety, and other related mental health problems; and this is not uncommon. Many teenagers turn to their phones when they lack social interaction in their lives. Another example of this is weight gain/loss. Excessive use of devices can cause a decline in physical activity and promote a not-so active lifestyle, creating a correlation between internet addiction and obesity.

   Technology today has made bullying easier than ever before. Cyber bullying is the use of electronic communication to bully someone; and this is not unheard of in our society, especially in schools. This can take many forms from as simple as repetitive messages to someone who no longer wants to be contacted, to the extent of deformation. Some other common methods of cyberbullying include repeated threats, hate speech, sexual harassment, impersonation, and exclusion. Often people’s motivation to bully others could fall under self-doubt, or that hurting others makes a person feel powerful. Some “benefits” of bullying online as opposed to face-to-face could include: 
   <br><br>
   lack of consequences - Many teenagers believe most people cyberbully because its entertaining – largely driven because they cannot see their victim’s reaction in person.
   <br><br>
   Anonymity – Cyberbullying allows a mode of communication where bullies can avoid facing the person; possibly to the extend of completely concealing their identify online.
   <br><br>
   Social pressure – Some people could believe that this kind of behaviour is acceptable within their social circle. This justifies their actions and is continually motived by the people around them.
   <br><br>
   Cyber bullying has been a large problem in society for the last 20 odd years; and it has been much easier for bullies to contact victims who do not want to be contacted. A child’s home use to be their safe space, but now with cyberbullying, bullies can reach you when you are at home, leaving no safe space for some people. Social media apps such as Instagram allows users to block other users. But this didn’t stop them from creating another account and messaging you from there. Thankfully, Instagram has done their best to prevent people from doing such things, but if a person is determined enough, they can get past this to be undetected by this system. Other security measures in place to help prevent this would be message requests if the user wishes to have a private account. 
   <br>Other methods of bullying can also come in video games, over the last 2 decades of video games we have seen a rise in cyberbullying in video games, these can be mostly apparent when looking at violent games such as Call of Duty. Call of Duty is a violent shooter, with a large learning curve. Some of these games from the last 10-15 years that they had developed a culture around bullying – today, games such as modern warfare 2 are looked back on as games that your mental health couldn’t survive. For some, this culture was obviously satire, but for the uninitiated, this can be a nightmare. It was mostly normal to find children on video games like this; making them easy targets for those who want to feel powerful. Cyberbullying can almost not be stopped in our society currently, technological advancements in society only make cyberbullying easier and more effective. This can be seen over the last 2 decades that we have made efforts to reduce cyber bullying, but alas. 
   <br><br>
   To conclude, advancements in society are something that we all should be looking forward to, but it is important to understand the implications of the technology we are deploying. Many of the problems I had outlined wasn’t caused by the technology itself, but the humans reaction to the technology; whether this be for financial gain or to boost their ego.
